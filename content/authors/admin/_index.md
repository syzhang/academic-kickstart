<!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks. -->

I am a post-doctoral Research Associate at the Computational and Biological Learning Lab in the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge. My current research focuses on understanding how humans learn and adapt to pain and relief, by modelling brain imaging and physiological data with learning algorithms. I am also include developing brain-computer interface and neurofeedback systems for chronic pain treatment.
