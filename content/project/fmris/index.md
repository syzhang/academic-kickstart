Experimental data obtained in learning experiments can be modelled using reinforcement learning algorithm. Behavioural data such as choices and physiological signals can be used to fit free parameters in the algorithm for individual participants. Generated predictors are then used to find neural correlates in brain images or correlation to subjective pain ratings.
